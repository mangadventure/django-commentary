Porting to ``commentary`` from ``django.contrib.comments``
===============================================================

To move from ``django.contrib.comments`` to ``commentary``,
follow these steps:

#. Install the comments app by running ``pip install django-commentary``.

#. In :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, replace ``'django.contrib.comments'``
   with ``'commentary'``.

   .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'commentary',
            ...
        )

#. In your project's ``urls.py``, replace the url include
   ``django.contrib.comments.urls`` with ``'commentary.urls'``:

   .. code-block:: python

        urlpatterns = [
            ...
            url(r'^comments/', include('commentary.urls')),
            ...
        ]

#. If your project had :doc:`customized the comments framework
   </custom>`, then update your imports to use the ``commentary``
   module instead of ``django.contrib.comments``. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

        from django.contrib.comments.models import Comment # old
        from commentary.models import Comment # new

        from django.contrib.comments.forms import CommentForm # old
        from commentary.forms import CommentForm # new

#. If your database schema already contains the tables and data
   for existing comments and you get an error like
   ``django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation "commentary" already exists``
   in your first subsequent migration, run 
   ``manage.py migrate commentary --fake-initial``.
